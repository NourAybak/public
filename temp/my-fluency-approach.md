Most of us know that Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing are the 4 skills of languages AND NOTICE THE ORDER HERE everyone learn their mother tongue through listening to people around them and then after a while they start speaking their first word and when we teach them how to write we first let them see how it's done (_reading_) lastly they write <br><br>
some prefer this approach where you get your ears used to the language, learn to say most common phrases _and_ make up phrases from what they know then start learning grammar to make less mistakes and increase their voc <br><br>

Vocabulary, Grammar, Comprehension, and the Accent.. those are the *true* 4 skills of my perspective Let's break it down <br><br>

### Listening & Comprehension
your ears are good and sound but we mean the *Comprehension* here you hear someone talk in the native way and you can't keep up with them *WHY?* because your brain is not yet trained well to comprehend phrases at the speed of how fast they talk like when you slow down a movie or song or tell someone "Could you speak slower please?"<br><br>

### Speaking & Learning the accent
up till now if you're keeping up with me without copying this blog and paste it into google translator you're saying these words out loud in your mind and if you move your tongue to read it out loud you're _speaking_ but often not with a native *accent*...<br><br>

# <span id="voc-and-grm">Why Voc and Grammar first?</span>

I think I speak for a decent amount of people when I say I wouldn't enjoy [friends](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/) much when I can neither get what they say nor even understand the subtitles. We eventually head to translation. That leads us to not foucsing with "getting our ears used to the accent" AND NOT EVEN ENJOYING THE SHOW because our eyes are so busy switching back and forth from the translation to the show. Again I think I don't need to further explain [WHY...](#voc-and-grm)
